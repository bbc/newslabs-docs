There is a subdued sadness in the air as Saudis take in the loss of their king. </paragraph><paragraph>People throughout the kingdom are mourning a man whom many viewed as a good monarch. A Jedawi I spoke to said that although it was known that Abdullah was ailing, to wake up to news of the king's death was distressing. Another Jedawi referred to the loss as like a family member passing away. </paragraph><paragraph>It is only after the king is later laid to rest, that people here and in the kingdom at large can begin to adjust to his passing.</paragraph><image id=\"80463177\"/><paragraph>Another of the late king's half-brothers, Muqrin, who is in his late 60s, has been named the new crown prince, according to an official statement. </paragraph><paragraph>Abdullah, Salman and Muqrin are all sons of the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz, usually referred to as Ibn Saud, who died in 1953. </paragraph><paragraph>King Salman called on the royal family's Allegiance Council to recognise Muqrin as his heir. He swiftly appointed Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as deputy crown prince, making him second in line to the throne, and named his own son, Mohammed bin Salman, as defence minister.</paragraph><paragraph>Other ministers, including foreign, oil and finance were kept in place, state TV reported.</paragraph><!-- Embedded video --><video media-id=\"80468880\">    <caption>King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud: \"We will never deviate from our constitution\"</caption>  </video><paragraph>The new king's profile was updated on his <!-- CPS Asset ID: 30947756 --><link><caption>official Twitter account</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"https://twitter.com/KingSalman\"/></link>, where he wrote: \"I ask God to help me succeed in my service of the dear [Saudi] people.\"</paragraph><paragraph>In keeping with traditions of Wahhabism - the ultra-conservative form of Sunni Islam followed by the kingdom - King Abdullah will be buried in an unmarked grave immediately after Friday prayers. </paragraph><paragraph>The Saudi religious establishment views every aspect of life and death as a submission to God's supreme will, and protocol permits no official mourning period. Government offices stay open and flags remain at full mast.</paragraph><image id=\"80463177\"/><crosshead>Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent</crosshead><paragraph>Saudi Arabia under King Salman faces a number of challenges. The first is ensuring the succession passes smoothly without any divisive jockeying for power within the ruling family. Then there is the ongoing threat from jihadists, both at home and across its borders. </paragraph><paragraph>Saudi Arabia is now sandwiched between an aggressive Islamic State (IS) to the north and al-Qaeda in Yemen to the south. Saudi warplanes have joined the US-led coalition in air strikes against IS, but this is deeply unpopular with many Saudis. </paragraph><paragraph>The government has yet to find a way to cope with mild calls for reforms, and is abusing anti-terror laws to silence reformers and punish its critics. Longer term, it faces a growing unemployment problem. About half the population is under 25 and there are nowhere near enough meaningful jobs for young Saudis. </paragraph><paragraph>But the country does at least have oil in its favour. With prices below $45 a barrel, Saudi Arabia is one of the very few exporting countries to still make big margins on production and exploration. That puts it in a powerful position on the world stage.</paragraph><image id=\"80463177\"/><paragraph>US President Barack Obama expressed his personal sympathies, and those of the American people, on Abdullah's death.</paragraph><paragraph>\"As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions. One of those convictions was his steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the US-Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East and beyond,\" he said.</paragraph><paragraph>Vice-President Joe Biden <!-- CPS Asset ID: 30947754 --><link><caption>tweeted</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"https://twitter.com/VP/status/558475859367964672\"/></link> that he would lead a delegation to Riyadh to pay respects.</paragraph><paragraph>UK Prime Minister David Cameron said Abdullah would be remembered for his \"commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths\".</paragraph><paragraph>Jordan's King Abdullah II cut short a visit to Davos, Switzerland, to travel to Saudi Arabia, as Jordan's royal court declared 40 days of mourning.</paragraph><paragraph>Israeli President Reuven Rivlin praised Abdullah's \"grounded, considered and responsible leadership\", while Iran offered Saudi Arabia its condolences and said its foreign minister would travel to Riyadh for an \"official ceremony\" on Saturday.</paragraph><!-- Embedded video --><video media-id=\"80463396\">    <caption>Frank Gardner says Saudi Arabia could face an increasing internal security problem following the death of King Abdullah</caption>  </video><paragraph><!-- CPS Asset ID: 10214554 --><itemMeta overtyped-headline=\"King Abdullah\"><url href=\"/news/world-middle-east-10214554\" xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\"/><assetTypeCode xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">STY</assetTypeCode><assetId xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">10214554</assetId><headline xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/article/b5c53243-9619-e059-e040-850a02846523\">Obituary: King Abdullah</headline><shortHeadline xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/article/b5c53243-9619-e059-e040-850a02846523\">Obituary: King Abdullah</shortHeadline><summary xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/article/b5c53243-9619-e059-e040-850a02846523\">A monarch who pursued a gentle process of reform against strong opposition from religious conservatives.</summary><section id=\"99125\" name=\"Middle East\" uri=\"/news/world/middle_east\" url-identifier=\"/news/world/middle_east\" xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\"/><title xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">BBC News - Obituary: King Abdullah</title><firstCreated xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">2010-06-02T10:43:10+00:00</firstCreated><firstPublished xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">2015-01-22T23:32:29+00:00</firstPublished><lastUpdated xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">2015-01-23T07:29:23+00:00</lastUpdated><lastPublished xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">2015-01-23T10:59:05+00:00</lastPublished><publicationStatus xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">PUBLISHED</publicationStatus><language xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">en-gb</language><site id=\"825\" code=\"news-v6\" name=\"BBC News\" front-page-uri=\"/news/front_page\" url-identifier=\"/news\" xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\"/><provider xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">cps</provider><workerCallingCard xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">NOLAPPS702-6007</workerCallingCard><hasShortForm xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/b5c53243-9618-e059-e040-850a02846523\">false</hasShortForm></itemMeta> was the 13th of the 45 sons of King Abdulaziz.
